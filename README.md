# FriendFinder

PURPOSE: This is a Friend Finder app deployed on Heroku. This app can be used by customers to find new Friends that think alike.

OVERVIEW: We have used Node JS and Express JS to create a local server to run the program. We have two HTML files, one is the homepage and other is the survey page which asks question about user. We have server.js file from which the program initiates. htmlRoutes.js includes webpage routes. apiRoutes.js includes the GET and POST command to the FriendList table. friend.js contains the FriendList table.

HOW TO USE: When you Navigate to the app it will take you to the Homepage. Click on Go To Survey and it will take you to the survey page, where you will have to enter your name and photo link and answer all 10 Questions. These fields are mandatory. Once you have all the fields filled in it will give you the result with best match person name and their photo.
